## 🤔 Reminder For Future Updates

In future updates, **Rift Walkers** will be protected by a key as well as the Creative Commons License. This key will only have to exist if I deem that there are
too many duplicate servers. In updates that will be closer, automatic updates will be released and will check once every 2 months or so for updates to ensure the
best security for the servers.

This mod is also for **Clients** to help with rendering custom mobs, blocks, items, and events. We will keep you updated when new features arise.
